      <p>A bill that would legalize “magic” mushrooms for the treatment of mental disorders was introduced last week by the New Jersey state Senate.</p>
      
      <p>Authored by the state Senate President Nicholas Scutari, the bill, according to its language, would allow residents over the age of 21 to “possess, store, use, ingest, inhale, process, transport, deliver without consideration, or distribute without consideration, four grams or less of psilocybin,” the psychedelic compound in “magic” mushrooms.</p>

      <h2>Two men caught on fire and suffered pretty serious burns at <a href="https://www.easthamptonstar.com/index.php/police-courts/2022630/police-logs-063022" target="_blank">the Goop store in Sag Harbor</a> after someone poured rubbing
      alcohol on top of a candle.</h2>
      <p>Police responded to a strange scene at Goop on Saturday evening, where two men had caught fire. They reported that rubbing alcohol had been added to candles, causing a large explosion and flames. Police were able to apply ice packs, but one man, who had a large burn on his back and ears, had to be taken by helicopter to Stony Brook University Hospital. The other, who had sustained facial burns, was transported by ambulance to Southampton Hospital.</p>

      <h1>If you have small children or dogs, watch out: Scientists have identified the eggs of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/30/toxocara-parasite-poorer-areas-parks-study-new-york" target="_blank">tiny infectious worms</a> lurking in our parks.</h1>
      <p>Scattered in cat sandboxes and dog runs around the world, there's a parasite invisible to the naked eye that mostly infects these creatures. It's a tiny worm that lives in the animals' muscles and digestive systems, but can spread to
      others.
    
      Sometimes, though, it infects humans. Increasingly researchers are concerned that children are inadvertently consuming these parasites, known as Toxocara, and so they are studying places where humans and pets come into contact with one another: city parks.</p>

      <p>In New York City, one of the locations of the studies performed in recent years, these parasites are present in parks in all five boroughs, and there are more of them in parks in more impoverished neighborhoods. Around the world other researchers are also finding Toxocara in parks.

      <h1>Authorities at a Bangkok airport caught a couple <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93awze/live-animal-bangkok-wildlife-trafficking" target="_blank">trying to smuggle</a> 35 turtles, 50 lizards, two white porcupines, two armadillos and 20 snakes, all inside two suitcases.</h1>
      <p>Nithya Raja and Zakia Sulthana Ebrahim were due to board a flight from Bangkok to Chennai, India on Monday when they were abruptly stopped at the airport's security checkpoint. The women had handed over their luggage—two suitcases—for a routine X-ray inspection, and something, evidently, had piqued the attention of the authorities.</p>
      
      <p>Moments later, wildlife officials were called to the scene at Suvarnabhumi Airport, where they opened the suitcases and discovered 109 live animals. Thirty-five turtles, 50 lizards, two white porcupines, two armadillos, and 20 snakes, all contained within the two pieces of luggage.</p>
